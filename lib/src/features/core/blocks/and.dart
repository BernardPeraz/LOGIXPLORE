AND gates are fundamental digital logic components that output HIGH only when both inputs are HIGH. They implement the Boolean AND operation using the logical expression A Â· B. In truth table terms, the output is 1 exclusively when input A AND input B equal 1. These gates serve as essential building blocks in digital circuits and computer processors. Understanding AND gates is crucial for designing complex logic systems and computational devices.''',
